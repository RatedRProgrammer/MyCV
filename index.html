    We use web-based applications in various aspects of our lives, including banking, healthcare,
    sports, entertainment, media, learning, commerce, and so much more. As a result, it has
    increased the use of web applications for many tasks and daily activities. These applications
    contain sensitive and essential data that needs to be safeguarded. In numerous sectors of
    Nepalese society, cyberattacks and threats have been gradually increasing. Security has been
    mostly neglected despite being a crucial aspect while developing web applications. This thesis
    aims to study how the Organizations of Nepal perceive and practice web application security
    management. This thesis investigates the use of Open Web Application Security Project's
    (OWASP) related security practices among security experts in Nepal to understand how
    different practices, approaches, and mitigation of security vulnerabilities are employed in
    Organizations in Nepal. This thesis includes the study of both technical and non-technical
    aspects related to web application security management. The study followed a mixed method
    approach, i.e., a sequential explanatory research approach. A survey was conducted first, in
    which eighty-seven valid responses were obtained. Then interviews with six security experts
    were conducted to understand the context better. This study contributes to the field of
    information security research. </p>
